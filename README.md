  THE BUDGET MAKER.
This is a code that prints out a budget or total payable amount that is supposed to be paid by a client who orders rice and from what distance. The total price for rice is calculated and the distance from place of order is checked then total amount is done plus the distance depending on how many miles away the client is.
I used a couple of steps to get to that from the intellij using java.


                            NOTES ON GIT.
According to Paolo Perrotta, Git is a content tracker which he defines it as getting in an onions core through it’s layers one by one. According to googles Git is a distributed version control system commonly used in software development for tracking changes in source code. 
All of them somehow relate and it exactly why it would be necessary to learn git step by step just like git itself as below;
 How Git operates;
1.	Version Control System: Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other. It keeps track of every change made to the code, enabling developers to revert to earlier versions if necessary.
2.	Repositories: In Git, a repository (or "repo") is a storage location where all the files of a project are stored, along with a history of all the changes made to these files. Repositories can be local (stored on your computer) or remote (stored on a server).
3.	Snapshots: Instead of keeping track of file changes, Git saves a snapshot of the entire project at each commit. If files haven't changed, Git doesn't store the file again but links to the previous identical file, making the system very efficient.
4.	Commits: A commit is like taking a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (a hash) and contains information about the changes, the author, and a message describing the changes. Commits form a linear history or a tree if branching is used.
5.	Branches: Branches are separate lines of development that allow multiple versions of a project to be developed simultaneously. The main branch in Git is usually called main or master. Developers create other branches to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main branch.
6.	Merging: Once work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into another branch (often the main branch). Git uses a three-way merge to combine changes from different branches. If there are conflicts (changes in the same part of the file), Git will require the user to resolve them manually.
7.	Pull and Push: Developers can download changes from a remote repository using git pull and upload their changes using git push. These commands keep the local repository in sync with the remote one.
8.	Cloning: Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. When you clone a repository, Git downloads all the project files and the complete history of changes.
9.	Staging Area: The staging area (or index) is an intermediate area where Git collects changes before a commit. This allows developers to selectively include files or changes in a commit.
10.	Distributed Nature: Unlike some version control systems that require a constant connection to a central server, Git is distributed. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository and history on their local machine, which means operations are fast and can be done offline.
Common Git Commands
•	git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
•	git clone <url>: Clone a remote repository.
•	git status: Check the status of the working directory and staging area.
•	git add <file>: Stage changes for the next commit.
•	git commit -m "message": Commit the staged changes with a message.
•	git branch: List all branches or create a new branch.
•	git checkout <branch>: Switch to a different branch./ we can also use switch command.
•	git merge <branch>: Merge the specified branch into the current branch.
•	git pull: Fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository.
•	git push: Push local changes to a remote repository
