  THE BUDGET MAKER.
This is a code that prints out a budget or total payable amount that is supposed to be paid by a client who orders rice and from what distance. The total price for rice is calculated and the distance from place of order is checked then total amount is done plus the distance depending on how many miles away the client is.
I used a couple of steps to get to that from the intellij using java.
